    <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>

    <p>In this blog I will talk about neuroplasticity and how it can be used to our benefit and how it can be our bane . <br>
        Neuroplasticity is a recent scientific idea that our brains are constantly reshaping throughout our entire lives through the method of practise and reinforcement .
        As our neurons fire and new circuits are created and like a highway the more neurons in that circuit fire the more pathways it forms like lanes for cars. <br> 
        So the more we practise something positive it loops back and gives us the ability to do more positive actions.
    </p>

    <p>
        The flip side to this is how it can reinforce your addiction. <br>
         The circuit in your brain that says “to hell with it” could be considered its own sub personality in your brain just the same as the circuit that says “lets do it”. <br>
          The circuit remains in your brain forever, however you can build another circuit to shut it down and you can help it decompose over time by not giving it what it wants. <br>
           But you have to not give it what it wants in all the contexts that you associate with the addiction or negative circuit. So you have a knight to fight on your side and a dragon to slay. And to use this to your benefit you need to be aware of it consciously.

    <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>

    <p>
        There are two types of mindsets we could cultivate.
         The growth mindset, and the fixed mindset.
          With a growth mindset people believe that new abilities can be developed through practise. <br>
           This mindset sees a challenge as an opportunity rather than an obstacle to reaching your goal. 
    </p>

    <p>
        A fixed mindset is one that believes the brain is only good at what it is good at. 
        To this mindset an obstacle is something to avoid the result is the only thing that is important. <br>
        This doesn't allow the person to become the person they need to be in order to advance in their chosen field.
