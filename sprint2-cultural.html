        <h1>My learning plan.</h1>
       <p> In this document I will type out a plan to outline a course of action to help me achieve my goals. This plan has to aim toward what I consider to be good for me.
This means good now, good a week from now and well into the future .
My long term goals are to have a stable job in the web development industry.</p>

<p> In order to achieve this I need to obtain a set of human skills that i may not currently possess patience being the main driver of this in my opinion. This is the main thing i need to develop if i am to be successful in my time in EDA .
Its something I must remind myself of constantly. 
Often it's a feeling I have when something doesn't come to me easily. I get a rush of frustration and it makes me liable to abandon the problem. I have to overcome this.</p>

<p> The flip side of this is that I find myself able to be very productive in short bursts 90 mins at a time. I've noticed that if i work like this with a pomodoro and a half hour break in between i'm able to get a great amount of work done in those bursts. </p>

<p> I don't know what to expect of my facilitator because I don't really know what is expected of him.I think of this as a moment to moment issue.If I have a small problem and i cant figure it out i will ask him on slack. If its a big problem I will give him more than a days notice to hold a meeting call with me and hopefully this is acceptable to him.</p>

<p> The main thing i have to tackle is my micro habits .</p>
