    <h1>Javascript Basics</h1>
    
    <h2>Javascript html and css</h2>
        <p>Together with html and css, Javascript is one of the core technologies of modern web development. <br>
         Html is responsible for the content of the page, css is reponsible for the presentation, and javascript allows for the action and dynamics of the web page. 
        </p>
    
    <h2>Control Flow</h2>

    <p>Control flow is the term which refers to to method in which the programmer
         controls the way the operations of the program are performed. <br>
            For example if we were to use a program to control the way to start our car it might look like this .

     <p>Or we could use a loop to control the temperature of our refrigerator which might look like this.

    <h2>arrays and objects</h2>

    <p>Arrays and objects are very similar in that they both contain multiples of information. <br>
            The main difference is that arrays act as a series of containers that function as a whole. <br> Having a single name but with the ability to store things within the subcompartments named elements . 
            Usually arrays are used to store the same type of thing 
    </p>
    
    <p>
            Objects are used to store different types of things while under a common identifier.
            Like arrays they still store multiple things but the difference being the type fo things can be different. It is possible to store an array within an object.
    </p>

    <h2>Functions</h2>

    <p>Functions are one of the most important building blocks of javascript.
         A functions is basically a set of statements that performs a task and/or calculates a value. <br>
          The use of functions comes from their ability to run the same piece of code without repeating it.
           So you can say if “a” conditions are met perform “x” function but “x” function could be used if “b” conditions are met also.
    </p>

    <h2>The DOM</h2>

    <p>
            The DOM is the acronym for “Document Object Model” its the method that brings
             all the separate technologies together on a web page. It lets the html and css interact
              and can change what we see. The DOM translates all the parts of the HTML into objects within the webpage . <br>
               These objects can be changed events can be written which allows for the parts of the webpage to become more 
               dynamic. To interact with the DOM a developer may use the inspect element of a web page which allows him to
                play with the page in the way they see fit.
