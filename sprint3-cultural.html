    <h1>Emotional intelligence</h1>
        
        <p>To talk about different forms of intelligence we need to look at how intelligence has been assessed and why so you can make up your own mind . <br>
        Multiple forms of intelligences have been theorized since the early nineties.
        The theory of emotional intelligence is a controversial one to say the least.
        </p>

        <p>
            The reason for this is because the theory conflicts with the definitional criteria that describe intelligence.
            You could have a word describe anything you like, for example you could say the ability to play a sport is a form of intelligence, the reason this becomes an issue is because you blur the lines of the definitional boundaries that the word is purposed for. <br>
            so perhaps “Talents” is a better word to describe the phenomena people are using “emotional intelligence” to describe.
        </p>

        <p>So you could say intelligence is whats common across all sets of intelligence tests .You could debate this and talk about what constitutes a test. 
            The way psychometricians have managed it is by not defining everything they measure as intelligence. <br> So some people are more socially adept, are we going to define that as intelligence? <br>
             No we call thats extroversion for example, or defining cooperativeness with emotional intelligence. <br> So the question becomes are you less intelligent if you’re competitive? Well no we've defined that as openness. 
            So is there anything left of these intelligences once we control for personality and IQ and the answer is no. there is nothing left.
            </p>

        <p>
            A category must be real (reliably measurable) and useful (predictive) to be considered valid scientifically. 
            I think the reason people cling to the multiple intelligences theory is that IQ is exceedingly stratifying and deterministic. <br>
            To think somebody is smarter than you is too similar to thinking that someone is straight  better than you; it's a menacing idea, especially for materialists. <br>
            What i mean is those who believe that people who can create valuable things only are valuable people. And they are valuable but thats not the only measure of value. <br>
            Those who make things better is a better measure of value and IQ is not nessesary for that.  

        </p>

        <p>
            That's why people need to stop seeing IQ as a measure with power over other traits and use it for what it actually is .
        A predictor of success across multiple domains . <br>
        And one that can be woefully inadequate when you account for the other traits needed to work in a professional environment .
        Traits that allow you to work well with others and increase your performance as a team. <br>
        And make things better for the people in your community. <br>
        After all what value is there in creating things if our lives arent improved as a result.
