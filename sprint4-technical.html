   <h1>Asking Questions</h1>

   <p>What i learned this week about how to improve my process. <br>
       I think the most important part is to ask questions, and to know how to ask questions.
    I clearly describe the problem to myself, I go through my code line by line do not rush this step.
     Take notes about what may be confusing let them sink in. BE PATIENT . <br>
     I have this problem when i want to solve a problem where i
      wish i could just find the solution and it would click instantly it 
      inevitably doesn't and i get frustrated and feel like giving up. I need to remind
       myself to take a deep breath and just go through it and let it pass
    </p>

    <p>
            One such problem was during a challenge where I had to manipulate objects in Javascript. <br>
             I googled the solution and there were many solutions but nothing to describe the concept in 
             a way that I would understand. <br>
            So i asked a friend. One who was knowledgeable about the subject, Instead of telling me the answer he explained the concept and I was able to get it.
            This kind of help is invaluable.

    <h2>Psuedocode</h2>

    <p>
            A concept I'm still struggling with. <br>
             The idea is in order to find the answer you need to know what the question is and ask yourself
              what is the question. <br>
            Try to put it into plain english and structure it in a way that's not valid code but makes sense to you.

    <h2>The Rubber Ducky</h2>

    <p>
            This method of explaining to someone else your problem and the function of your code
             often brings you to understand the problem you were facing the entire time.
              This is because it forces you to see your code from a different perspective.
    </p>

    <h2>Console Logging</h2>

    <p>
            After each slice of code you write its a good idea to test if it actually works by using the console.log
             function inside the browser. Its a way we can run the code without altering anything in it.
    </p>

    <h2>Googling</h2>

    <p>
            You may find some success by just googling your problem. <br>
             Often times the hardest thing about googling is the amount of irrelevant
              information you need to sift through first.
