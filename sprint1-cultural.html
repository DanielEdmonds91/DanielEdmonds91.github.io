            <h1>a moral evaluation </h1>

            <p> This will be a short blog about my values and how I perceive my moral system. </p>
            
            
            <p> I worked as a restaurant manager for ten or so years it caused me to come across many situations where I had to make meaningful morally weighted decisions. <br> One such instance was as follows . I had a fellow employee who i was in charge of managing who i actually got along quite well, she still has a positive impression of me to this day.
            The problem I had was this person had no motivation or desire to do her job competently at all, <br> she would come in late everyday be very unproductive and was completely uncoachable this is a nightmare in a hospitality environment because it creates a toxicity amongst the staff who were putting in real effort.
            After many weeks of trying to improve matters to no avail eventually I decided she had to go, it was my job to fire her not an easy one at that because we were actually friends . <br> I had to tap into my animus and let her go despite it creating a lot of hardship for her. If you can't say no to people you can't negotiate. 
            It was hard to do but necessary and the consequences were a lost friend. The Anima i was projecting made the job hard my job had to override my compassion.</p>
            
            <h2>MY CULTURE</h2>
            
            <p> That of the pakeha, A colonizer? A  frontiersman? 
            Idk the political answers and i cant say you whos right but i can say my part .
            In my view the culture of the pakeha is the culture of someone whos trying to create something from a blank slate, no proper heritage. <br>
            The queens country discarded and the maori country negotiated... perhaps unfairly. <br>
            What does this mean for my values? Im a pragmatist, I consider truth the highest value tradition to me is only as valuable as far as its use. And I don't just mean its physical use it could mean its place of importance in our identity and culture.</p>

            <h2>MY STRENGTHS</h2>
            
            <p> On a myers briggs test i am an intp and i found that to describe my personality perfectly:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>I'm a great analytical and abstract thinker, my imagination is constantly sparking a to be honest it gets annoying and won't shut up sometimes.</li>
                <li>Im open minded.</li>
                <li>I'm obsessive when it comes to an idea im excited about.</li>
                <li>I'm honest and straightforward.</li>
            </ul>
            	
            <h2>My weaknesses</h2>
            
            <ul>
                <li>I'm too introverted sometimes</li>
                <li>Im insensitive to how people feel but i can develop this with practise</li>
                <li>I hate nonsensical bureaucratic rules.or even just guidelines that i dont see a use for ( see how I didn't add others perspectives on me in this blog)</li>
                <li>I have trouble committing to one thing for an extended period and time.</li>
                <li>My attention flickers rapidly and im constantly firing off ideas for starting new projects before bringing the previous one to its logical conclusion.</li>
            </ul>	

            <h2>HOW THIS RELATES</h2>
            <p> I expect i may be able to get a handle on conceptual systems easier than some. Im in a lucky positions in that ive had a lot of practise in working on my limitations through my previous job. <br>
            However i think my main obstacle will be keeping my unwieldy brain on the right track . Its mediated by unconscious forces that are out of my control. so the obstacle is to figure out a system where i can make that work. <br>
            In a previous project in an IT course i did i was the project manager for a research project, i was one of three in our group. Unfortunately half way through our research projecrt one member was falling behind .
             The way i got around this wasw to ratchet up the communication. 
             Explain in detail step by step what was required and by when and do it in a way that was considerate of that persons mental state.But i left it too late to kick this startegy into gear, i would probably monitor this situation more closely if i was put in the same situation again.</p>
